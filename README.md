**Project Name:** Voiceover Application with Deep Learning

**Project Description:**

Text-to-speech (TTS) analysis involves the study and evaluation of how text is converted into spoken language using TTS technology. 

This analysis focuses on various aspects, including the quality, accuracy, naturalness, and intelligibility of the generated speech. 

It often includes the assessment of linguistic features such as pronunciation, prosody (intonation, stress, rhythm), and emotion.

**Project Purpose:** 

Developing an application that converts the text we give into audio and presents it to us as an output in mp3 format.

**Dataset:** In this project, we will use the dataset we created ourselves.

**Libraries We Will Use**

**tensorflow:** It is an open source deep learning library.

**gTTS (Google Text-To-Speech):** It is a library that we use to convert text to audio.

**playsound:** We use the "PlaySound" library to record texts in MP3 format or in a format that we can listen to .

**os:** The OS library is the library that allows us to interact with the operating system we use.In this way, we can listen to the sound we recorded with the sound system of the operating system we use.

**Sound Synthesis Steps**

**1.Text Analysis:** The text is analyzed according to grammar rules. Sentence structure and emphasis are determined.

**2.Phonetic Transformation:** It is determined how each word in the text will be pronounced.

**3.Sound Synthesis:** Finally, sound synthesis is done.Phonetic transcription is converted into sound waves.At this stage, pre-recorded human voices or completely artificially produced sounds are used.
